#p2(t) is the genotypic frequency for the AA diploid genotype in generation t
# WAA, WAa & Waa are the fitnesses for each genotype AA, Aa and aa respectively.

pt1 <- function(wAA, wAa, waa, pt) { #pt_0)

#This result may be explained by the role that the slope plays in the function, as it determines what y_deterministic equals. By aking the slop 0, it makes the mean constant with the changing x. 


#Finally, using either a for loop or an Rish method (i.e. one of the apply family of functions) try a grid of
#sample sizes from 10 to 100 by 5 (i.e. 10, 15, 20. . . ., 95, 100) with the slope being fixed at 0.1, intercept
#= 0.5 and residual standard error as 1.5. At each different sample size, run the simulation 100 times
#and report the frequency at which the p value is less than 0.05. What pattern do you observe. Plotting
#the proportion of p-values less than 0.05 on the Y axis VS sample size (X axis) may be very helpful
